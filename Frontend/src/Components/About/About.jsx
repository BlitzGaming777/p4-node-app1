        <span className='indent-line'></span>The React Recipe Finder App I have
        developed is designed to help users discover and explore various recipes
        conviniently. However, I want to clarify that the images, titles,
        ingredients and descriptions used in the app are not my own, but are
        sourced from external platforms solely for the purpose of creating a
        project for my coding bootcamp. The app is not intended for commercial
        use, but rather for submission as a project. I have utilized the
        materials under the principle of fair use. Credits to the original
        sources.
